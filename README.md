# Budget-Tracker-PWA

This budget tracker application might seem basic on the inside, but in fact is very helpful for travelers due to the fact that it will work well offline. This application is a test of PWA and NoSQL knowledge and helps to reinforce the learnings before we work creating full MERN stack applications. We used Mongoose, created Service Workers and IndexedDb to make this an app that works well offline which is helpful for users who want to use this budget tracker with unstable or unreliable internet connections.

To use the app, all you will have to do is give your expense a name and a cost and then click whether or not the cost subtract's money from your budget or add's money to it.

## User-Story
GIVEN a budget tracker without an internet connection  
WHEN the user inputs an expense or deposit  
THEN they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit  
WHEN the user reestablishes an internet connection  
THEN the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated
